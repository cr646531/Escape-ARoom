          <p>Escape ARoom is a real-time global competition.</p>
          <p>Play as an individual or join a team on the account page.</p>
          <p>
            Each week we will open a new room, full of puzzles that need to be solved.
            Teams from across the world will compete to solve the puzzles as fast as possible and be the first to <b style={{"color": "red"}}>Escape ARoom</b>.

            To turn your living room, office, kitchen, bathroom (!?) into an escape room,
            <b style={{"color": "red"}}> download the ARoom Markers PDF, print out the markers, and set them up in your room. </b>
            We recommend keeping at least 3 ft between markers - and placing the door marker on your door (duh).
